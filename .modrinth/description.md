# TruHearts

The vanilla heart bar lies a little. It rounds your health to the nearest half-heart pip, so the actual float Minecraft uses internally is hidden — that pip showing "9½ hearts" might really mean `19.00`, `19.45`, or `18.91`, and you'd never know.

**TruHearts** prints the real number, in red, right above your heart bar.

> ♥ 18.5 / 20

That's it. One small overlay, one line of text. Half-second to learn, instant to read at a glance.

## What you actually see

- **Your current HP as a float**, with up to two decimals. Whole values trim cleanly: `20`, not `20.00`. Single-decimal values trim the trailing zero: `18.5`, not `18.50`. Two-decimal precision when the value warrants it: `12.34`.
- **Absorption appears inline in gold** when active — `♥ 18.5 / 20 + 8` after an enchanted golden apple, or whatever you've topped up with. Disappears when your absorption runs out.
- **The overlay sits in the right place at all times.** Wearing armor? It shifts up a row to clear the armor icons. Got absorption hearts? Another row up. Both? Both rows. No collision with the vanilla HUD, ever.
- **Toggle it on or off in-game.** A keybind under **Controls → TruHearts** is a master switch that hides everything TruHearts renders. A separate keybind flips just the recent-damage log if you want the HP readout without the log. Both unbound by default; assign whatever keys you like. Preferences stick between sessions.
- **Recent-damage log.** Stacks the last 5 hits above the HP readout. Each entry shows the exact damage amount (measured as HP + absorption delta, so hits eaten by absorption still count) and a short label for the source — mob name for attacks (`Zombie`, `Skeleton`, `Warden`) or environmental cause (`Fall`, `Fire`, `Lava`, `Drowned`, `Explosion`, `Void`, …). Newest at the bottom; older entries fade out over a 10 s lifetime.
- **Works on Minecraft 26.1 and 26.2.** One download covers both minor lines. A 26.1 install and a 26.2 install run the same jar.

## Why you might want this

- **You can see when small damage actually hit you.** Fire ticks, magic damage, environmental wear — the heart pips snap to half-hearts and lose the in-between numbers. TruHearts shows you the exact `0.42` your shield just absorbed.
- **You can see regen working in real time.** Watch HP tick up by the actual `0.5` or `1.0` increments instead of waiting for a pip to flip.
- **PVP / hardcore players know what's about to kill them.** "One more hit" and "one more half-pip" aren't the same thing.

## What this mod does *not* do

- Doesn't change gameplay. No new mechanics, no balance changes.
- Doesn't show other entities' HP yet (planned for a future version).
- Doesn't show a damage-dealt number on attack yet (planned for a future version).
- Doesn't show food saturation or exhaustion (intentionally cut — those values aren't reliably available client-side on multiplayer servers, and we'd rather ship nothing than something wrong).
